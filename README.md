# Business card app from Android Basics with Compose course.
The goal of the project was to practice using composable functions to layout a simple business card.

This exercise gave me practice designing simple layouts with Column and Row composables,
how to arrange composables using horizontalAlignment and verticalArrangement parameters, 
and how to customize Compose elements with a Modifier object.

I am not sure this is the best design but it was good practice in use of composables
and I certainly understand everything in this code.
I am excited to learn more sophisticated ways of laying out a UI
